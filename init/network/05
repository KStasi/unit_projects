# ip address of the DNS that responds to slash16.org
# DNS server is a computer server that contains a database of public IP addresses
# and their associated hostnames, and in most cases serves to resolve those names
# to ip addresses as requested.
#
# there are two options:
# dig slash16.org | awk '{ if ($2 == "SERVER:" ) { print $3 } }' | cut -d "#" -f1
# or
nslookup slash16.org | awk '{ if ($1 == "Server:" ) { print $2 } }'
